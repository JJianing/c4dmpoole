On 4-8 May 2020, several C4DM researchers will participate virtually at the <b>[IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2020)](https://2020.ieeeicassp.org/)</b>. ICASSP is the flagship conference of the IEEE's Signal Processing Society and is the leading conference in the field of signal processing. For this year, ICASSP is organised as a virtual conference offering [free registration](https://2020.ieeeicassp.org/registration/) to attendees.

As in previous years, the Centre for Digital Music will have a strong presence at the conference, both in terms of numbers and overall impact. The following papers authored/co-authored by C4DM members will be presented:

* Modeling plate and spring reverberation using a DSP-informed deep neural network (M. A. Martínez Ramírez, E. Benetos, and J. D. Reiss)
