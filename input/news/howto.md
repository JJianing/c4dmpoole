title: News How-To
---

C4DM MEMBERS: here's how to contribute a [news](news/) item:

1. Make sure you're logged in to Github
2. Visit [https://github.com/c4dm/c4dmpoole/new/master/input/news](https://github.com/c4dm/c4dmpoole/new/master/input/news)
3. Where it says "Name your file" use a filename like this:

       `news.YYYY-MM-DD.Great_Thing_Happens.md`
       
   (with the desired date, and the desired headline such as "Great Thing Happens" in this example)

If you have permission you can directly save it. 
If not, github will create a "Pull Request" which one of the C4DM site maintainers will check and merge in.

To create a pull request, once you have written your news item and named it as above (do not forget the `news.` prefix!), you first have to click on "Propose new file".
Then, on the following page, you have to click "Create pull request".
Only then will it be registered as a pull request and one of the C4DM site maintainers can approve it and merge it in.
