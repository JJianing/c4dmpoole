The most widely-used software tools from C4DM are **[Sonic Visualiser](http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/)** and **[aubio](http://aubio.org/)**. Other C4DM software is available on [isophonics.org](http://isophonics.org/) and our previous [download page](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/downloads/).

We also run the [**SoundSoftware** code repository](http://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/) which hosts software projects for audio and music researchers.

**Datasets:** see our [C4DM Zenodo community page (actively maintained)](https://zenodo.org/communities/c4dm/) and the [C4DM Research Data Repository (historical)](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/rdr/).

The QMUL Library also maintains a [Subject Guide for Digital Music](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/library/subject-guides/electronic-engineering-and-computer-science/useful-websites/digital-music-multimedia/), covering sections on Websites for digital study of music, Software, and Professional organisations/socities on digital music.
