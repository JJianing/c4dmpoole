title: Sonic Interaction Design
----

The Sonic Interaction Design Lab at the Centre for Digital Music explores through new ways of encountering sound from interactive art to real time data sonification. Sonic Interaction Design is about designing and evaluating interactive systems that prioritise sound over vision.

This is especially important in the post-screen world we live in (Bryan-Kinns, 2017) where the pervasive, affective, and co-temporal features of sound contribute to the design of:
* Mobile and wearable interaction
* System for creative, expressive, artistic interaction
* Tangible and physical interaction i.e. objects which do not have screens
* Internet of Things e.g. smart appliances such as Alexa
* Eyes-free interaction e.g. whilst attending to another task such as driving
* Accessible interaction
